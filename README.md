StanCode SC101: Software Engineering Foundations


This repository contains my coursework and projects from the StanCode SC101 (Applications) program. Throughout the curriculum, I applied Python to solve complex algorithmic problems, manage data structures like Lists and Dictionaries, and build interactive applications using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These assignments demonstrate my ability to translate logic into functional code and bridge the gap between product requirements and technical implementation.

Focusing on scalable software design, I developed projects ranging from automated data processing scripts to event-driven graphical interfaces. My goal in completing these modules is to strengthen my technical communication with engineering teams and better oversee AI-driven product lifecycles at Adobe, ensuring a deeper understanding of the underlying architecture behind customer data platforms.
